<p style="float: right;">Hello! My name is Steven Lasch, and I am a junior at Mercyhurst University studying data science with a minor in Religious Studies. I have many interests, including a love of the outdoors, hiking and road biking, playing guitar and piano, and studying languages and writing systems. 

I also enjoy programming, and this has led me to incorporate my interest in language to my major, in the form of natural language processing. Around campus, I am also a computer science tutor, former writing consultant, and active member of Campus Ministry. 

Thank you for checking out my site!</p>
