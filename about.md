Hello! My name is Steven Lasch, and I am currently a senior at Mercyhurst University, where I am studying data science with a minor in religious studies. I have always had a diverse range of interests, including languages, spending time outdoors, hiking, road biking, and playing music on my guitar and piano.

My love for programming and fascination with language led me to incorporate natural language processing into my major. I find it exciting to be able to use technology to translate, analyze, and interpret language. 

Around campus you can probably find me in the Campus Ministry lounge, or in any of the Data Science labs under the library. Thanks for taking the time to visit my site and learn a little more about me!
